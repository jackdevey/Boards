# ðŸ“º Boards
Boards is a CLI written in node.js that shows accurate & live railway station departure boards in the terminal, using data sourced from the [National Rail Enquiries API](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/46391.aspx).

## Using Boards
Generating a live departure board is easy, and can be done in the terminal using just one command!
> Boards clears the terminal before running to provide a cleaner viewing experience
```shell
boards [CRS] [NUM]
```
Please note the following parameters:
| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| - | - | - | - |
| CRS | The Computer Reservation System code for the station, you can find a list of all of these [here](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/48541.aspx) | Yes | - |
| NUM | The number of services to display on the board | No | 10 |

Boards keeps running to provide a live feed of all services, but can be stopped by using `Ctrl + C` to terminate the program.
